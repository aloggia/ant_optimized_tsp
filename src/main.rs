 Algorithm idea: Pick starting node
 Create array of all possible destinations from that node
 Weight each edge for picking -> all edges have a distance/cost, but we need to weight them so the
 ant randomly picks an edge to take: Higher the distance, higher the weight
 When a node is visited, mark as visited so the ant isn't doubling back on itself
 Save the path the ant took as an array listing all visited nodes in order of visit
    - Because the ant can only travel on edges, the path will always be valid
    - The total cost of the path is
